TCP File Sharing Network :--
1 -- > Designed and implemented a robust network that enabled multiple clients to simultaneously connect to a server and securely share files over a TCP/IP
network using Python socket programming.
2 -- > Utilized multi-threading to support concurrent client connections, allowing efficient and real-time file sharing between clients and the server with-
out performance degradation, handling up to 10+ simultaneous users.
3 -- > Implemented TCP's congestion control, flow control, and error-handling features to maintain high reliability in file transmission, reducing data packet
loss and ensuring integrity.
4 -- > Developed a retry mechanism using TCPâ€™s inherent acknowledgment and retransmission features, ensuring seamless file transfers even under high network 
load conditions.
